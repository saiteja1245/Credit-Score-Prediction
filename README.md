# Credit Score Prediction

A machine learning project to predict individual credit scores based on financial and demographic data using various classification algorithms. Built using R, this project focuses on data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals into credit score categories (e.g., Good, Standard, Poor) based on their financial profiles.
